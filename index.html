    <h1>IoT - Internet of Things</h1>
    <p>Internet of Things (IoT) describes the interconnection and communication of a network of 'things' which can work together to perform functions and exchange data between each other. In this case 'things' refer to any device that can connect to and communicate within a network.</p>
    <p>The connection of these devices can streamline, and therefore enhance, our current way of life. IoT has a vast and varied number of uses and can be applied to nearly any circumstance. IoT is evident in small, interconnected household appliances such as smart lights and smart speakers which can all be automated through devices such as Google Home or Amazon Echo. However, IoT can also be found on a much larger scale with the emergence of completely interconnected 'Smart Cities'.</p>
